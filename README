Script Used to update clan stats on a website for more accurate reporting, and for additional 
datapoints.

A couple of options exist for the program. u for update, and c for collect.

Paths are currently hardcoded for my local machine, but it should be pretty easy to see what 
those are.

An example way to run this program is `scrapy crawl crup -a task=u`

-a stands for arguments, and task=u specifies a variable named tasks that will have the value of u.
In this case, the convention is that u is equal to update.
